# No Diff Detected for Test Generation (main..HEAD)

As of this check, `git diff main..HEAD` returned no changed files. Per the request to
"only generate unit tests for those specific files within the diff," there are no targets
to add or append tests to at this time.

## What we ran

```bash
# Confirm current refs
git branch --show-current
git rev-parse HEAD
git rev-parse main

# Check diff against base
git diff --name-only main..HEAD
git diff --shortstat main..HEAD
```

All of the above returned no file changes between `HEAD` and `main`.

## How CI discovers and runs tests here

- TypeScript (Jest): Each package under `src/*` runs `npm test` if it has a test script.
  The workflow detects packages dynamically and runs tests if present.
- Python (pytest via uv): A package is tested if it has a `test/` or `tests/` directory,
  or if `pyproject.toml` configures pytest.

This is reflected in:
- `.github/workflows/typescript.yml`
- `.github/workflows/python.yml`

## Options to proceed

1) Provide an alternate base ref
   - If you meant another base (e.g., `upstream/main`, a tag, or a SHA), run:
     ```bash
     git fetch --all --prune
     git diff --name-only <BASE_REF>..HEAD
     ```
     Then re-run test generation strictly for the listed files.

2) Land commits on this branch
   - Push code changes and we will generate tests for the files listed by:
     ```bash
     git diff --name-only main..HEAD
     ```

3) Expand scope (if acceptable)
   - If you want coverage improvements despite no diff, consider:
     - Python fetch server (`src/fetch`): Add pytest unit tests that mock `httpx` and verify:
       - `extract_content_from_html` (content/no-content)
       - `get_robots_txt_url` (schemes, ports)
       - `check_may_autonomously_fetch_url` (401/403, other 4xx, disallow via robots, connection errors)
       - `fetch_url` (HTML vs non-HTML, `force_raw`, 4xx, connection errors, truncation messages)
     - TypeScript servers without tests (`src/memory`, `src/sequentialthinking`):
       - These currently lack Jest setup; to align with `src/filesystem`, add dev-only deps:
         `jest`, `ts-jest`, `@jest/globals`, and a `jest.config.cjs`. Then test pure logic only
         (avoid starting the stdio servers).

## Handy commands for targeting only changed files

```bash
# List changed TS & PY sources (adjust <BASE_REF> as needed)
git diff --name-only <BASE_REF>..HEAD \
  | grep -E '^(src/).*\.(ts|py)$' || true
```

## Next steps

- If you reply with one of the options below, we can act immediately:
  - `custom <BASE_REF>`: Generate tests strictly for `<BASE_REF>..HEAD`.
  - `python`: Add pytest tests for `src/fetch` (no new dependencies).
  - `ts+python`: Add Jest-based tests to `src/memory` and `src/sequentialthinking`
    (adds dev-only Jest deps to those packages) plus pytest for `src/fetch`.

This note exists to document why no tests were added right now, and how to proceed quickly.
