# Testing Scope â€“ origin/copilot/fix-build-and-deploy-issues

Date: October 19, 2025

This branch was analyzed against the base ref "main" to determine which files changed and therefore should receive tests.

- Base ref: main (commit 5aedaab)
- Head ref: HEAD (commit 0197890)
- Tree hash (both): 38e6287965ac7937633b78cf5224d60e158eec74

Result: git diff main..HEAD is empty. There are no code or test file differences between this branch and main.

Per the request, test generation is limited strictly to files present in the diff. Since there are no changed files, no new tests have been added in this branch.

Notes:
- The repository uses Jest for TypeScript tests (see src/filesystem/jest.config.cjs) and pytest for Python tests (see src/git/tests, src/time/test).
- Several modules (e.g., src/everything, src/memory, src/sequentialthinking, src/fetch) currently have little to no direct unit tests. If you want broader coverage beyond the branch diff constraint, please confirm and we can generate comprehensive tests for those modules using the existing frameworks without adding new dependencies.

If you intended to compare against a different base (or expected changes here), please verify:
1) The current branch is correct
2) Any local changes are committed
3) The base reference to compare against (e.g., a specific tag or SHA) 

Once a non-empty diff exists, we will generate thorough, maintainable tests for only those changed files.
